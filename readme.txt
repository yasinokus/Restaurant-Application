The purpose of this project was to implement a restaurant application for taking orders, calculating expenses, and managing revenues.

In the first part of the project, I developed the model, and in the second part, I integrated it into a graphical user interface (GUI).

I utilized several classes and implemented interfaces to structure the various components.  
I also employed the `instanceof` keyword to maintain the hierarchy during the development process.  
Additionally, I made significant comments in the relevant sections of the code.

Upon completion, the code functioned as expected. When running the `main.java`, the console displayed the following output:

```
Welcome to OZU Restaurant!

-------------------------Main Menu-------------------------
1: Create Order
2: Manage Restaurant
3: Exit Program
-----------------------------------------------------------
>>
```

For example, if I enter "4" in the command window, the console responds with:

```
>> 4
Try Again...
-------------------------Main Menu-------------------------
1: Create Order
2: Manage Restaurant
3: Exit Program
-----------------------------------------------------------
>>
```

All outputs are consistent with those described in Project2.pdf (which I have included in my project branch).
